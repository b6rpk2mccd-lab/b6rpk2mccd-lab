  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    I studied massage therapy at the American Massage and Bodywork Institute, where I built a strong foundation in clinical bodywork. I also studied shiatsu under my mentor, which shaped how I think about pressure, movement, and the body as a connected system rather than a set of isolated muscles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fitness has always been important to me, which led me to become a Certified Personal Trainer through the National Academy of Sports Medicine. That background strongly influences how I practice massage. I use bodywork to reduce restriction, improve movement efficiency, and support how the body is meant to function. When tissue moves better, workouts are more productive, recovery improves, and circulation increases.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work is focused, intentional, and individualized. Massage is not about routine or guesswork. It is a practical tool to help the body move well, train better, and feel more capable over time.
