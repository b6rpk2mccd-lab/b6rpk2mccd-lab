About
I studied massage therapy at the American Massage and Bodywork Institute, where I built a strong foundation in clinical bodywork. I also studied shiatsu under my mentor, which shaped how I think about pressure, movement, and the body as a connected system rather than a set of isolated muscles.
Fitness has always been important to me, which led me to become a Certified Personal Trainer through the National Academy of Sports Medicine. That background strongly influences how I practice massage. I use bodywork to reduce restriction, improve movement efficiency, and support how the body is meant to function. When tissue moves better, workouts are more productive, recovery improves, and circulation increases.
My work is focused, intentional, and individualized. Massage is not about routine or guesswork. It is a practical tool to help the body move well, train better, and feel more capable over time.
